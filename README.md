## üñ•Ô∏è Front-End Studies

This repository is dedicated to enhancing front-end web development skills, with a focus on JavaScript and its application within the React library.
The studies are based on the [Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) by Dr. Angela Yu, as well as additional resources discovered through independent exploration.

The primary resource in this repository is the **`/Notes`** folder, which contains summaries and notes on key concepts covered throughout the studies. These notes aim to support not only my learning but also assist individuals interested in entering the field of front-end web development. The notes include:
- **Document Object Model (DOM)**: Event listeners, DOM manipulation, and more
- **React Library**: State management, props, hooks, and other core concepts
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Promises, callbacks, async/await, and the Fetch AP
- **Playwright Best Practices**: Guidance on using Playwright for testing

Additionally, the repository includes two projects for hands-on practice:
- **`/Advanced JS and DOM Manipulation`** ‚Äî This folder contains a small project‚Äîa drum kit application. The app plays sounds when the user presses specific keys on the keyboard or clicks buttons on the screen. This project was learned during Dr. Angela Yu's course and serves as an introduction to DOM manipulation.

- **`/React`** ‚Äî This folder contains two projects:
  - **`Keeper-App`**: A simple CRUD application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes. This project is still in progress.
  - **`login-page`**: A draft of a login page created to practice concepts learned during the DOM and React studies.
